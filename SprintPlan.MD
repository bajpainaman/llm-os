# LLM-RAG-OS: Sprint Plan

This sprint covers foundational tasks for building the initial prototype of LLM-RAG-OS. The goal is to set up the development environment, implement core skeletons, and establish testing infrastructure.

## Sprint Duration
- **Length**: 2 weeks (10 working days)
- **Team**: Kernel developers, AI engineers, QA engineers

## Objectives
1. Establish working development environment with LLM support
2. Implement initial LLM kernel process skeleton
3. Create basic agent management framework
4. Build command-line natural language interface prototype
5. Integrate minimal RAG memory backend
6. Set up automated testing for kernel modules and agents

## Planned Tasks

### Week 1
| Day | Task | Owner |
|-----|------|-------|
| 1   | Finalize development hardware setup, clone repo, verify kernel build | DevOps |
| 2   | Configure Python environment with LLM libraries | DevOps |
| 3   | Create LLM kernel process skeleton in `/llm-rag-os-kernel/kernel/llm/` | Kernel Dev |
| 4   | Draft agent lifecycle management structures | Kernel Dev |
| 5   | Implement CLI interface scaffolding | AI Engineer |

### Week 2
| Day | Task | Owner |
|-----|------|-------|
| 6   | Implement minimal RAG vector store for working memory | AI Engineer |
| 7   | Integrate RAG store with LLM kernel skeleton | Kernel Dev |
| 8   | Develop unit tests for kernel and agent modules | QA |
| 9   | Configure QEMU-based VM testing environment | DevOps |
| 10  | Run integration tests and fix blocking issues | Team |

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Build with `make test` to verify kernel modules and agent functions
- **Integration Tests**: Boot QEMU VM running LLM-RAG-OS prototype; run scripted NL commands
- **Performance Baseline**: Measure LLM response latency and memory usage
- **Security Checks**: Static analysis for common vulnerabilities

## Deliverables
- Functional build environment documented in `README.md`
- Initial LLM kernel and agent framework committed to repo
- Basic CLI interface demonstrating NL command parsing
- RAG memory backend storing and retrieving embeddings
- Test suite with passing unit and integration tests
- Sprint review notes summarizing progress and next steps


## Notes
- Day 1 setup script added at scripts/day1_setup.sh to automate initial environment tasks. Actual kernel build not executed in repository due to environment limitations.

- Kernel build attempted but failed due to missing libelf-dev; installation added. Compilation interrupted due to time limits.
